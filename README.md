Various ComputerCraft programs I've written.
Written for ComputerCraft 1.57, certain programs also require OpenPeripheral 0.2.1.

## I want these programs!
Easy. Simply enable the HTTP API (if it hasn't been already) and run

```
pastebin get bRdEzsXh github
```

Now you can run `github yoplitein computercraft-progs program.lua` to fetch any program in this repo (or other repos!)
